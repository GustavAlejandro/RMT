# Random Matrix Theory: from zero to hero

Welcome to this series/project where I will explain, discuss and share my ideas, projects, and results from the random matrix theory. Nonetheless, this is not I will not discuss the theory deeply, considering this space more informal wise focused on numerical/worked-on applications.

In this repository I'll talk: 
+ Random variables
+ Random walks
+ Random Matrices (Obviously)
+ Covariance Matrices
+ Machine Learning
+ Statistical Mechanics
+ etc

Including projects/application in:
+ Finance
+ Machine Learning
+ Lagrange multipliyers
+ Dyson Brownian Motion
+ Ising Model
+ Monte Carlo Methods
+ And more

Maybe I'll create another repository exclusively about machine learning or competitive programming following the same philosophy, I don't know yet. Well, this is the idea however I really have to write an atrocious amount of text between the lines.

Without further ado let's start with the motivation:

# Motivation
# Motivation
I'll start by saying Random Matrix Theory isn't a joke, the theoretical aspects, proofs, theorems, and tools are sometimes nonintuitive, and many essential books named 'Introductions' are not introductions whatsoever, such as Introduction to random matrix theory by Alice Guionnet or Random Matrices by Madan Lal Metha. I'm not saying that these books are bad, just don't work as introductory material. 

Consider this repository as my personal amaetur notes, projects end worked numerical exercises, I'll leave the citations where everyone can see the proof of the equations.
