# Random Matrix Theory: from zero to hero

Welcome to this series/project where I will explain, discuss and share my ideas, projects, and results from the random matrix theory. Nonetheless, this is not I will not discuss the theory deeply, considering this space more informal wise focused on numerical/worked-on applications.

In this repository I'll talk: 
+ Random variables
+ Random walks
+ Random Matrices (Obviously)
+ Covariance Matrices
+ Machine Learning
+ Statistical Mechanics
+ etc

Including projects/application in:
+ Finance
+ Machine Learning
+ Lagrange multipliyers
+ Dyson Brownian Motion
+ Ising Model
+ And more

Maybe I'll create another repository exclusively about machine learning or competitive programming following the same philosophy, I don't know yet. Well, this is the idea however I really have to write an atrocious amount of text between the lines.

Without further ado let's start with the motivation:
