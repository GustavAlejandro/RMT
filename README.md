# Random Matrix Theory: from zero to hero

Welcome to this series/project where I will explain, discuss and share my ideas, projects and results related to Random Matrix Theory. Nevertheless, this is not I will not discuss the theory deeply, considering this space more informal wise focused on numerical/worked-on applications.

In this repository, I am going to talk:+ Random variables

+ Random walks
+ Random Matrices (Obviously)
+ Covariance Matrices
+ Machine Learning
+ Statistical Mechanics
+ etc

Including projects/applications in:
+ Finance
+ Machine Learning
+ Lagrange multipliers
+ Dyson Brownian Motion
+ Ising Model
+ Monte Carlo Methods
+ And more

Maybe I'll do another repository just about machine learning or competitive programming with the same philosophy, I don't know yet. Well, this is the idea, but I really have a lot of text to write between the lines.

Without any further ado, let's start with the motivation:

# Motivation
Let me start by saying that Random Matrix Theory is no joke, the theoretical aspects, proofs, theorems, and tools are sometimes not intuitive, and many important books called "introductions" are not introductions at all, such as Introduction to Random Matrix Theory by Alice Guionnet or Random Matrices by Madan Lal Metha. I'm not saying these books are bad, they just don't work as introductory material. 


I recommend Introduction to Random Matrices - Theory and Practice by Giacomo Livan, Marcel Novaes, Pierpaolo Vivo, you can get the material on Arxiv 
https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.07903


Dr. Pierpaoli Vivo has a youtube lecture series on youtube, I leave the link below:

Another option is Cleaning large correlation matrices: tools from random matrix theory by JoÃ«l Bun, Jean-Philippe Bouchaud, Marc Potters, pre-printed on arxiv:
https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.08104


And a little bit more advanced material focused on the combinatorics approach I'd recommend Dr. Roland Speicher's lectures on youtube, again, these lectures are advanced material:

Consider this repository as my personal amateur notes, projects end worked numerical exercises, I'll leave the citations where everyone can see the proof of the equations.
